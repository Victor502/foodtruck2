## What it is
  This is a community based food truck "spotter".  You will be able to mark the spot of a food truck and once verified by "X" number of people it will show that it has been verified to be true.  There will also be a way for food truck owners to give their location, this would be a Vendor Verified instance.  In a way it will resemble how wazes does community based "things.
